   Left , Root , Right
   case1:  left--> null print() root , and then move -->right
   case2:  we can only go to left , if right most guy is connected to curr say root, in above example 6 should be connected
          curr = cur->left (thread , creating thread )
          |
          |__ if current is connected to thread we need to remove the thread and move right, cur = cur-> right
